## About Me

I am a 20-something-year-old from Sweden who has been residing in the United States for some time now. I am passionately interested in many things, including 16th-19th century history, classical literature, and animal rights. I studied computer science as an undergrad and am now working to earn my MSc in data science. 

Some other things I would say in "name three fun facts about yourself" games:
- I've been fascinated with tech, especially data, since I played an educational game on the family computer in the early 2000s that introduced database logic and algorithms in a fun and creative way.
- I worked at a police station after my undergrad as their specialized tech support.
- I was a competitive equestrian during my junior years, but now prefer the less exciting rides on more lazy horses.
