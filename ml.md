### Unit 1 - 3 The 4th Industrial Revolution <a name="unit1"></a>

The advancement of Industry 4.0 through artificial intelligence (AI), automation technology, and big data analytics has transformed social media platforms, internet accessibility, and data science disciplines. While AI personalization on social media platforms increases user engagement, it also generates ethical issues about the spread of misinformation and the protection of personal data (Schwab 2016). AI-driven speech-to-text systems enhance inclusivity, while data science predictive analytics create more accurate decision-making capabilities.A significant failure of Industry 4.0 occurred during the Meta outage on October 4th, 2021 when Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp were offline for six hours. A configuration error in backbone routers triggered the incident which blocked global communications and disrupted commerce (Meta, 2021). The outage resulted in businesses losing advertising income and the value of Meta stock fell by 5%, which decreased Mark Zuckerbergâ€™s wealth by $6 billion according to The Guardian (2021). The outage demonstrated how centralized digital systems pose significant risks and underscored the importance of developing decentralized and robust systems (Cloudflare, 2021).

The evolution of Industry 4.0 demands a careful balance between technological innovation and ethical standards along with infrastructure strength. It is essential for organizations to channel their resources into adaptive technologies and crisis management strategies to lessen technological dependence risks.

### Unit 2 EDA <a name="unit3"></a>
In this unit, we were able to perform EDA on the Auto-MPG dataset. I set out to identify missing values, estimate skewness and kurtosis. I created a heat correalation map along with various other visualizations of parameters to analyze. This excerise felt like a great introductory point as it allowed me to play around with various plotting techniques and replace some categorical values with numerical values to experiment with the effects in outcome.

### Unit 3 Correlation and Regression <a name="unit3"></a>
Using Jupyter notebooks, in this unit, we modified parameters and observed how changes affect data correlation and regression. This unit provided another foundational layer of understanding to various types of regressions: Polynomial, Multiple Linear, Linear, and Pearson Correlation. These exercises were more challenging to me, I kept confusing the multiple techniques and doubting my understanding of the unit concepts. My understanding was more solidified thanks to the visualizations generated through testing. 

Linear Regression experiment: Adding random noise to our data changes the regression model.

Pearson correlation experiment: Changing covariance highly affects the data in this model.
