## Machine Learning

### Learning Outcomes
- Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.
- Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.
- Apply and critically appraise machine learning techniques to real-world problems, particularly where technical risk and uncertainty is involved.
- Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.

### Unit 1 - 3 The 4th Industrial Revolution

The advancement of Industry 4.0 through artificial intelligence (AI), automation technology, and big data analytics has transformed social media platforms, internet accessibility, and data science disciplines. While AI personalization on social media platforms increases user engagement, it also generates ethical issues about the spread of misinformation and the protection of personal data (Schwab 2016). AI-driven speech-to-text systems enhance inclusivity, while data science predictive analytics create more accurate decision-making capabilities.A significant failure of Industry 4.0 occurred during the Meta outage on October 4th, 2021 when Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp were offline for six hours. A configuration error in backbone routers triggered the incident which blocked global communications and disrupted commerce (Meta, 2021). The outage resulted in businesses losing advertising income and the value of Meta stock fell by 5%, which decreased Mark Zuckerbergâ€™s wealth by $6 billion according to The Guardian (2021). The outage demonstrated how centralized digital systems pose significant risks and underscored the importance of developing decentralized and robust systems (Cloudflare, 2021).

The evolution of Industry 4.0 demands a careful balance between technological innovation and ethical standards along with infrastructure strength. It is essential for organizations to channel their resources into adaptive technologies and crisis management strategies to lessen technological dependence risks.
