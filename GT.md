## 📊 Data Presentation Manual

The dashboard features a **Region Filter** located in the **top-right corner** of the interface.

### 🔍 Region Filter Interaction

By left-clicking the region filter, the user is presented with a drop-down list of selectable regions.

Once a region is selected (e.g., **Asia Pacific**), the dashboard’s visual components — including the key metric cards, treemap, bar graph, map, and lists of hottest and coldest countries — will update to reflect data from that specific region.

To **remove the region filter**, users can either re-open the dropdown and select **(ALL)**, or use the clear filter icon in the top right (Figure 4).

- **Bar Graph Hover **: Hover over bars in the **Temperature by Region** chart to see average 100-year temperatures.

- **Click to Drill-Down **: Left-clicking any region (in the bar graph or treemap) filters all visuals to that region. For example, selecting **Europe** reveals a drop in average temperature compared to **Africa**.

- **Scroll to Zoom**: Use your mouse scroll wheel to zoom into regions on the map — ideal for inspecting smaller countries like those in the Balkans.

## 📈 Trend Analysis Over Time

- **Hover for Trends **: The **Temperature Over Time** graph allows users to hover over data points to reveal the average temperature by decade.

- **Color Scale Interpretation **: The **Avg. 100-Year Temperature (1921–2021)** scale uses color gradients — blue representing the coldest (-4.7°C) and red the warmest — to unify visuals across the dashboard.
